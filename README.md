# FoodBridge

FoodBridge is dedicated to solving one of Americaâ€™s critical issues: **food waste**. While nearly 40% of food produced in the U.S. goes uneaten, millions of people struggle to access healthy meals. **FoodBridge** seeks to address this by connecting surplus food from restaurants, cafes, and bakeries with communities in need.

## Mission

Our goal is simple: to reduce food waste by redistributing unsold food to those experiencing hunger. We aim to foster a solution where businesses reduce waste, and individuals in need receive the nourishment they deserve.

## How It Works

1. **Local Business Partnerships**: Restaurants, cafes, and bakeries committed to reducing waste list unsold food on our platform.
2. **Food Distribution**: Individuals can easily find and claim available food through our platform, ensuring that good meals don't go to waste.
3. **Recognition for Partners**: Participating businesses gain public visibility as part of the fight against food waste, encouraging more businesses to join in.

## Key Features

- **Community-Centered**: We ensure that surplus food reaches those in need, preventing waste and promoting food security.
- **Free Access**: Both businesses and recipients benefit from a completely free platform, where meals can be shared with no financial burden.
- **Environmental Impact**: By reducing food waste, we help lower methane emissions and other negative environmental impacts.

## Our Commitment to Charity

FoodBridge operates on a 100% charity-based model. We are driven by the desire to make a difference, not profit. Our funding comes from:
- **Donations**: Individual and corporate contributions fuel our growth.
- **Sponsorships**: Partner organizations help us expand our reach.
- **Advertising**: Collaborations with like-minded businesses help promote our cause.

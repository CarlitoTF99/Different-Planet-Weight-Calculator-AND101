## Notes

While doing the app I was not sure what to do, so then I remembered that the professor said something about calculating the weight in another planet and that was the inspiration for me to make this app.
I came across many difficulties and many things I had to learn on my own to implement them into my app, I also did not want my app to be very simple and just have a blank background so I went ahead and had fun with it.
In conclusion, making this app was quite fun and challenging as well as educational, since I learned quite a lot in the process of making it. Like how to implement animations into my layouts, how to use strings and apply them into my spinners,
how to set click listeners and how to make click listeners switch from one activity to the to the other.
